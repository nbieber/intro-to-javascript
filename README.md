# Intro to JavaScript

This lesson is adapted from Dan Phiffer's 1-hour introduction to programming that he delivered at [Trade School](http://tradeschool.ourgoods.org/).

I have adapted it into a 3-hour lesson plan for the [New York Code & Design Academy](http://www.nycda.com/).

There are four main things here:

* `intro-to-javascript.key` - Dan's original Keynote slides
* `hello-world.html` - exactly what it sounds like
* `hide-content.html` - a simple jQuery `fade` example
* `slide-show.html` - a more fully-fledged slide show example
